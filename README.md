# Curl by Example Minibook

Curl (<strong>c</strong>lient for <strong>URL</strong>s) is a tool for client-side internet transfers (uploads and downloads) using a specific protocol (such as HTTP, FTP or IMAP), where the endpoint is identified by a URL. Curl runs on 92 operating systems and has over 20 billion installations worldwide.

Curl has extensive reference documentation and even a 500-page book devoted entirely to it. I wanted something lighter, so I made this interactive step-by-step guide to essential curl operations. You can read it from start to finish to (hopefully) learn more about curl, or jump to a specific use case that interests you.

The guide is available in the following formats:

[Download PDF](https://github.com/nalgeon/curl-by-example/blob/main/curl-by-example.pdf) (1 MB) |
[Read online](https://antonz.org/curl-by-example/) |
[Try playground](https://codapi.org/curl/)

The guide is partially based on the 3.5-hour workshop [Mastering the curl command line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5vZWHP-RqU) by [DanielÂ Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/), the author of curl.
